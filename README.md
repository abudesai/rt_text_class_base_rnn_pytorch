Bidirectional RNN in PyTorch for Text Classification - Base problem category as per Ready Tensor specifications.
Both LSTM and GRU are supported. Hyperparameter tuning picks the better choice for given dataset.
Uses custom-built preprocessor to tokenize and pad/truncate date to fixed sequence length.
